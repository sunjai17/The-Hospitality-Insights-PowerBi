## 🎯 Motivation :

In this project, I followed the tutorial by codebasics on YouTube to learn how to build a data analysis dashboard using Power BI. The tutorial features Abhishek Anand, a revenue manager at OYO, and Hemanand, a data analytics expert. I learned the real time process of discussing client requirements, mocking up a dashboard, understanding hospitality domain metrics, cleaning and formatting data, performing data modeling, and creating calculated metrics using DAX.

## 🚀 Features

The dashboard includes the following features:

- **Revenue**: Visualizes revenue trends over time.
- **Occupancy %**: Displays the percentage of occupied rooms over a selected period.
- **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)**: Calculates and presents the revenue generated per available room.
- **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)**: Shows the number of sellable room nights per day.
- **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: Presents the average rate per room per day.
- **DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)**: Illustrates the number of rooms booked per day.
- **DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights)**: Displays the number of rooms utilized per day.
- **Weekly Metrics Trends**: Visualizes the trends of various metrics on a weekly basis.
- **Revenue by City and Category**: Provides insights into revenue generated by different cities and hotel categories.
